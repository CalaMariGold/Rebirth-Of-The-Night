I could find a naturally defensible area, like a mountainside or a cave, or try to build up a walled shelter. If I try to shelter somewhere that's too small or too bright, I'm sure to end up as something's dinner."

I have noticed creatures that hold pickaxes can break hard materials like stone. Those seem to be pretty rare, so I should be mostly safe. If I want to be extra safe, I could smelt the cobblestone and then craft it into $(item)stone bricks$() for increased protection."
