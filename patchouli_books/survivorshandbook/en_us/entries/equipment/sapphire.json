Holding it in my hands feels unlike any mineral Iâ€™ve held before, seeming to be a solid in form but a liquid in sensation. I felt a sense of longing within this material, like it wanted to leave it solid state and explore the world freely."

The utility applications for this particular gem seems plentiful. The tools crafted allow you to $(thing)explore land much easier$(), like you're flowing across the terrain. I feel free when using sapphire. It makes me want to explore this world and see what else it has to offer."
